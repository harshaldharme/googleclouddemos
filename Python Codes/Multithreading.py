# Multithreading allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently, which can help improve performance for I/O-bound tasks like network requests. Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, but multithreading can still be useful for I/O-bound tasks.
